    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A cobbler — not to be confused with a crisp or crumble — is a deep-dish fruit dessert with a sweetened fruit filling that is topped off with a biscuit-like dough. The dough may cover the entire dish or be dropped by the spoonful, earning it the name "cobbler" for its resemblance to a cobblestone street. It gives you the same fruit-and-pastry combination as pie, but without all the effort. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 fresh peaches - peeled, pitted and sliced into thin wedges</li>
        <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter, chilled and cut into small pieces</li>
        <li>¼ cup boiling water</li>
        <li>Mix together 3 tablespoons white sugar and 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>In a large bowl, combine peaches, 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon, nutmeg, lemon juice, and cornstarch. Toss to coat evenly, and pour into a 2 quart baking dish. Bake in preheated oven for 10 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine flour, 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar, baking powder, and salt. Blend in butter with your fingertips, or a pastry blender, until mixture resembles coarse meal. Stir in water until just combined.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Remove peaches from oven, and drop spoonfuls of topping over them. Sprinkle entire cobbler with the sugar and cinnamon mixture. Bake until topping is golden, about 30 minutes.</p>
